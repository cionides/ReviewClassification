__OVERVIEW/OBJECTIVE:__ Several Java applications used on a Yelp data set as well as XML output generated by Stanford CoreNLP POS Tagger.

__FUNCTIONALITY:__ These Java applications were not meant to be run all at once, but instead were mostly used to process the data set and generate a Feature table
to be used in a SVM.

The whole process of classifying was a combination of programs and tools.  The order that the programs should be run in, is as follows:

* ReviewProcessor
* POS Tagging--with Stanford Core NLP
* XMLParser
* FeaturesLoader
* Classification--with RapidMiner
* TestSetProcessor
* TestSetFeatureLoader
* Prediction--with RapidMiner

__RESOURCES/DATA SETS:__ The data was obtained from the Kaggle Yelp Recruiting Competition, and can be viewed
at: http://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recruiting/data. I DID NOT include the data sets OR  the xml files due to size, but all instances where they would 
be needed or used should be noted in comments or the projects README file.

__NOTE:__ Please see the report.pdf for a full description of the project and the reasoning behind some of the decisions I made.
Each of the five project directories contains a README file explaining how it works, what it needs to run, etc.
