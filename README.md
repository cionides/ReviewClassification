OVERVIEW/OBJECTIVE: Several Java applications used on a Yelp data set as well as XML output generated by Stanford CoreNLP POS Tagger.

FUNCTIONALITY: These Java applications were not meant to be run all at once, but instead were mostly used to process the data set and generate a Feature table
to be used in a SVM.

The whole process of classifying was a combination of programs and tools.  The order that the programs should be run in, is as follows:

* ReviewProcessor
* POS Tagging--with Stanford Core NLP
* XMLParser
* FeaturesLoader
* Classification--with RapidMiner
* TestSetProcessor
* TestSetFeatureLoader
* Prediction--with RapidMiner

RESOURES/DATA SETS: The data was obtained from the Kaggle Yelp Recruiting Competition, and can be viewed
